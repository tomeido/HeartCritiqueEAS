## 2024-05-19 - Restoring Focus to Dynamically Re-rendered Elements
**Learning:** In a single-page application where list items trigger detail views and the list might re-render while the detail is open, storing DOM node references to restore focus upon closing the detail view is fragile. Nodes may detach, causing focus restoration to fail silently.
**Action:** Always attach a stable, unique `data-id` attribute to list items and use `document.querySelector` with that ID to query for the fresh DOM node and call `.focus({ preventScroll: true })` on it when the detail view closes.
